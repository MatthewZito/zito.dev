For our card list we want to have four in a row, but because we're not using any media queries we set our minmax value to 300px, which will fit nicely on a small mobile. By using repeat and autofit the browser does the hard work and will fit what it can into a row and then start another, so we can go from four through to a single column layout with one line of code.
